# PWN PHONE - DREAM DEVICE FOR HACKERS

The Pwn Phone is a real-life product made by a Boston-based startup called Pwnie Express. The "dream device for hackers" allows users to check if there are any vulnerabilities in wired, wireless, or Bluetooth networks, and it looks like a regular cell phone. If you have a spare $1,095 sitting around, you can buy one here.

but if you have few things then you can also build your own Pwn Phone.

## My Opinion :

I know because of Mr.Robot's popularity many people would like to try it.. but currently i think the developers of Pwn Phone stoped working on this project because there is no update or latest version available of the previous pwn phone rom, even the old rom is now not available in their official website.. In past few months many people requested me to upload the pwn phone's rom that's why i'm updating this repository now..

i recommend you guys to try [Kali Nethunter](https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-nethunter/). it is also free and much better than pwn phone and most important thing, you will receive the regular updates..
